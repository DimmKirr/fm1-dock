"""fm1-dock's BLE-MIDI (HX, firmware/src/ble/hx.h) in fm1-emu, as far as it goes without a radio model:
  off       the default: HX found and checked, BLUETOOTH OFF, the radio never started; the sine plays
  nocal     BLUETOOTH ON from the list, no stored trims: NO CAL, nothing started; ON kept after a reboot
  trims     stock's VM at 0xE8000 (Optimist's V15 extract): ON runs the radio's start-up program against
            the emulator's empty BT registers within its bounds, then advertises; the sine plays on; after a
            reboot it advertises from boot; 0xE7000-0xE9FFF is left as it was
  safe      OCT+ held at power-on (safe boot) with ON saved: HELD, the radio not started; ON kept
  missing   HX's flash damaged (as a boot firmware leaves it): refused, nothing of HX runs; the sine plays
  none      HX's flash erased (tools/build.py --no-ble): "not in this build", no BLUETOOTH line
